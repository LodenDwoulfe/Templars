            <h2 class="section-title">Who We Are</h2>
            <p>The Obsidian Sun Templars are a devoted and elite order of warriors, spellcasters, and acolytes committed to the Sacred Flame. They recognize the dual nature of the Light and the Sacred Flameâ€”powerful tools that can bring salvation or destruction. Emerging from ancient Thalassian traditions, the Templars combine their deep spiritual discipline with martial prowess, striving to shield Azeroth from threats and to inspire hope wherever they go.</p>
            <p>Founded during a time of great turmoil, the Templars have evolved into an order known for their resolve, integrity, and unwavering loyalty. Their mission is to guard the Sacred Flame, protect the innocent, and wield the Flame as a beacon against the darkness. The Templars adhere to a code that emphasizes the balance between creation and destruction, using their power to ensure that the innocent are protected and that darkness is purged.</p>

                <p>The Pyrechanters are the mystical backbone of the Obsidian Sun Templars. These spellcasters dedicate their lives to studying the Sacred Flame's arcane properties, unraveling its mysteries, and discovering new ways to wield its power. They use the Flame to cleanse corruption, heal their allies, and obliterate their enemies.

They conduct the sacred rituals, provide moral and spiritual guidance, and maintain the connection between the order and the Sacred Flame. Flamewardens are entrusted with the most important rites, including induction ceremonies, oaths of allegiance, and the blessings bestowed upon weapons and armor.</p>
                <p>Flamewardens are also the caretakers of the Sacred Flame itself, ensuring that it is never extinguished and that it continues to burn brightly as a symbol of hope and resilience. They provide emotional support to members who have faced traumatic experiences, using their knowledge of sacred healing to mend both body and spirit.</p>
