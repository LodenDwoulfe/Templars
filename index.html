            <h2 class="section-title">Who We Are</h2>
            <p>The Obsidian Sun Templars are a devoted and elite order of warriors, spellcasters, and acolytes committed to the Sacred Flame. They recognize the dual nature of the Light and the Sacred Flame—powerful tools that can bring salvation or destruction. Emerging from ancient Thalassian traditions, the Templars combine their deep spiritual discipline with martial prowess, striving to shield Azeroth from threats and to inspire hope wherever they go.</p>
            <p>Founded during a time of great turmoil, the Templars have evolved into an order known for their resolve, integrity, and unwavering loyalty. Their mission is to guard the Sacred Flame, protect the innocent, and wield the Flame as a beacon against the darkness. The Templars adhere to a code that emphasizes the balance between creation and destruction, using their power to ensure that the innocent are protected and that darkness is purged.</p>
